# Hi, I'm Angelo, Software Engineer üëã
I'm a Software Engineer from Italy. I mainly deal with Android and Front-end development. Currently I'm trying to broaden my knowledge about Back-end development, Machine Learning and Data Science. When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me watching TV shows, writing an article, or running with my headphones.

## üî≠ What I‚Äôm currently working on
* [Keypify](https://keypify.com): an offline password manager for Android. Get it on [Google Play](https://bit.ly/keypify)

    - App-to-PC fast sharing.
    - Backup and restore with 2FA.
