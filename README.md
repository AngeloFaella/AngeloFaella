# Hi, I'm Angelo, Software Engineer üëã
I'm a Software Engineer from Italy. I mainly deal with Android and Front-end development. Currently I'm trying to broaden my knowledge about Web development, mobile development and Data Science. When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me watching TV shows, writing an article, or running with my headphones.

## üî≠ What I‚Äôm currently working on
* [Keypify](https://keypify.com): an offline password manager for Android. Get it on [Google Play](https://bit.ly/keypify) 

  **Some of the main features**:
    - Offline management: all the keys are stored only on user devices using AES encryption.
    - Fingerprint auth, no master password to remember.
    - Safe key sharing.
    - Random generator of strong password.
    - App-to-PC fast sharing.
    - Backup and restore with 2FA.
    
  **Tech stack**:
    - Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel, Room, ...)
    - OkHttp3 library
    - AWS Lambda (Java, Nodejs)
